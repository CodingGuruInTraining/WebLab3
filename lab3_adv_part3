By entering HTML elements to the input box, I was able to change some aspects of the page such as the
color of bullet points.
If left unchecked, this could allow others to break some part of the page or even
gain access to the web servers.
To prevent this, there could be a keypress event watching for certain characters and immediately delete
them. Another option may be to replace the same specific characters from the input string before any
other action is taken.
